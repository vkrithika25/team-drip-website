  "text": "Our mission is to alleviate the effects of high rates of diabetes on the community of Puerto Penasco, Mexico, a tourist town with a population of about 60,000.Â This mission was born from a needs assessment conducted by our overarching organization, M-HEAL, in early 2020; the assessment found that Puerto Penasco has a higher prevalence of diabetes than the worldwide average, and social stigma and misinformation related to diabetic wound care has led to many diabetic amputations, with amputees finding it difficult to return to work and reintegrate into the community.",

  "title": "OUR APPROACH",
  "text": "In collaboration with clinicians in Puerto Penasco, at the University of Michigan, and beyond, we use a two-pronged approach to work towards our mission.<br><br>Our <b>educational subteam</b> aims to design education pamphlets regarding preventative measures against diabetic foot ulcers that could lead to amputation if unchecked. We use the graphic design software, Figma, as a tool to design our pamphlet and have found it very useful in putting the pamphlet together while being aware of cultural norms and perspectives of diabetic treatment. <br><br>On the other hand, our <b>technical subteam</b> aims to prototype a low-cost adaptable prosthetic leg for diabetic amputees in Puerto Penasco. We are currently finishing up our prototype of a prosthetic knee and ideating other bioengineering solutions we can work towards in the future.<br><br>Our <b>business subteam</b> is our newest subteam, and aims to gain financial support for our cause as well as collaborate with organizations and communities striving for similar goals, in Puerto Penasco and beyond.",
